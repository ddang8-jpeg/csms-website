John graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), as a Meyerhoff Scholar, in 2015 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. He received an M.S.E in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2017 from The Johns Hopkins University and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Ralph Etienne-Cummings. His area of research is centered around low power, event-based biomedical sensing and analysis. He is currently performing research developing a multimodal wearable sensor array to analyze distributed networks of biosignals and inform clinicians of the cognitive development in patients who have undergone traumatic brain injuries.
