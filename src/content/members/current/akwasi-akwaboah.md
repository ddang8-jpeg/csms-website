Akwasi Akwaboah joined the Computational Sensory-Motor Systems (CSMS) Lab in Fall 2020 and is working towards his Ph.D. He will be receiving the MSE in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD in Summer 2022 en route to the Ph.D.

He received the B.Sc. Degree in Biomedical Engineering (First Class Honors) from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana in 2017. He also received the M.S. degree in Electronics Engineering from Norfolk State University, Norfolk, VA, USA in 2020. His master's thesis there focused on the formulation of a heuristically optimized computational model of a stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte with implications in cardiac safety pharmacology. He subsequently worked at the BioElectronic Vision Lab (BEVL) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA in 2020, where he collaborated on research on retinal prostheses, calcium imaging, and neural electrode characterization.

His current interests, birthed from past experiences and perceived prospects of the fields, include the following: neural interfaces, bio-inspired algorithms, computational biology, and neuromorphic circuits and systems. In this light, he is actively working on two projects:

1. Digital/mixed-mode implementations of an optimized nearest neighbor Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) with applications in learning.
2. A parallel multichannel electrochemical impedance spectrometer for rapid neural electrode characterization.

On the lighter side, Akwasi loves to cook and listen to classical and Afrobeats music.
