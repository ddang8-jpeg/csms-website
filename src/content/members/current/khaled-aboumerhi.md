Khaled is currently a 5th year PhD Candidate and Ferdinand Hamburger Jr. Fellow in the Dept. of ECE at Johns Hopkins. He received his BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati with a minor in nanotechnology and mathematics. While at UC, Khaled worked with Marc Cahay on simulating wave-packet
propagation through nano-scale devices.

As an undergraduate research fellow working with Gerhard Klimeck at Purdue University, Khaled used the NanoElectronic Modeling Tool (NEMO5) to contribute to the Quantum Dot Lab, a nano-crystal visualization tool hosted on nanohub.org. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Khaled, alongside colleagues Soumyajit Ray and Amparo Güemes-Gonzales, launched a COVID-19 predictive app that was used by thousands across the US to predict future coronavirus hotspots.

In 2021, Khaled received the prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to work with Giacomo Indiveri at ETH Zürich. There, he focused on neuromorphic applications in medicine, such as spiking neural network modeling. Khaled has given talks at numerous conferences about visual saliency, compressive sampling algorithms for nerve recordings, and lifelong learning using random forests. In his free time, Khaled enjoys playing violin, Arabic oud, and artisanal cooking.
