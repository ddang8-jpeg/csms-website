**After you have an account created on the ECE server, set up the Cadence environment using the following steps:**

- Open a new terminal window with `Ctl-Alt-T` or by right-clicking the desktop and selecting “Open in terminal.”
- Make a new directory with the command `mkdir ECE491` (or `ECE216` for Intro to VLSI). This is where all your Cadence files will be located.
- Change your working directory to the new directory with `cd ECE491`.
- Set up Cadence by typing `cadence ncsu`.
  - You only need to run this command the first time you use Cadence (or when you create a new Cadence directory).
  - **Note:** `ncsu` must be in lowercase for this to work.
- Start Cadence by typing `cadence` from the ECE491 directory.

The window above is called the **Command Interpreter Window (CIW).** This window represents the **Design Framework II** environment and provides access to Cadence through its menus or its input line using **SKILL** commands. The CIW window is the control window for the Cadence software.
