There will be several conventions used in this manual. The mouse on the Sun machines has three (3) buttons. The following is some terminology we will use in relation to mouse operations:

- **“Click left”** - press and release the left mouse button (quickly)
- **“Click right”** - press and release the right mouse button (quickly)
- **“Click middle”** - press and release the middle mouse button (quickly)
- **“Drag left”** - press and hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse.
- **“Drag right”** - press and hold the right mouse button while moving the mouse.
- **“Drag middle”** - press and hold the middle mouse button while moving the mouse.
- **“<...>”** - press the key on the keyboard that corresponds to what is inside the `<...>`
- **“type** `whatever` **”** - you should type (verbatim) whatever is in boldfaced print
