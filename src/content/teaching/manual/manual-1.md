This manual is intended primarily for students in **ECE 491: Basic Digital Design** offered at Johns Hopkins University. Basic knowledge of how CMOS transistors operate is required. The main goal of this manual is to teach you to use the Cadence Design Environment to design and test digital CMOS circuits. This manual will walk you through all the necessary steps for designing and testing an inverter using the NSCU toolkit.

First, we are going to create a schematic for the inverter. We will then create a symbol for the inverter and test the transient and DC characteristics of this inverter using the Analog Artist Simulator. Next, we are going to create a layout for the inverter and test the transient and DC characteristics on the layout of the inverter. Finally, we are going to create a behavioral view for the inverter in Verilog XL and simulate its behavior.
