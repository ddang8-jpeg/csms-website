      Over the past 25 years, Ralph Etienne-Cummings’ research has developed through three main phases. In the early
      part of his career, he studied biologically inspired sensors and sensory computation systems, primarily in the
      form of vision sensors. Typically, these systems were implemented with Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI)
      technology and were used to extract information about the environment and to guide the “attention” of other
      computation systems.

      In the middle part of his career, he studied how these systems can be hosted onto robots. At that point he also
      started to model spinal neural circuits in silicon, and develop robots to study legged locomotion. Both VLSI
      circuits and biomorphic robots were developed and used in these studies. More recently, he has evolved this work
      to include brain-machine interfaces and neural prosthesis devices. Specifically, he started looking at spinal and
      cortical prosthesis devices and robotic systems to restore function after injury and for human augmentation. This
      area has required close collaboration with neuroscientists to gain access to animal models (i.e. lamprey, cat,
      ferret and monkey preparations).
