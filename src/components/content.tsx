    Over the past 25 years, Ralph Etienne-Cummings’ research has developed through three main phases. In the
    early part of his career, he studied biologically inspired sensors and sensory computation systems, primarily
    in the form of vision sensors. Typically, these systems were implemented with Very Large Scale Integrated
    (VLSI) technology and were used to extract information about the environment and to guide the “attention” of
    other computation systems. In the middle part of his career, he studied how these systems can be hosted onto
    robots. At that point he also started to model spinal neural circuits in silicon, and develop robots to study
    legged locomotion. Both VLSI circuits and biomorphic robots were developed and used in these studies. More
    recently, he has evolved this work to include brain-machine interfaces and neural prosthesis devices.
    Specifically, he started looking at spinal and cortical prosthesis devices and robotic systems to restore
    function after injury and for human augmentation. This area has required close collaboration with
    neuroscientists to gain access to animal models (i.e. lamprey, cat, ferret and monkey preparations).
